## Project 1

This Project is a node web application with frontend in html/css/js and bootstrap. Its a website of a blogging platform consisting of a cover page, sign in page and user account page. The sign in is without check as it doesnt have any database connected as of now. 
Make sure to download node_modules and bootstrap elements before exploring my work in a similar folder as this project. 
Here is a static representation of my project on netlify hosting site :
